# UX/UI Design Lecture


## Notes
- Usability: measure of how effectively a person can
    - navigate an interface
    - find information
    - achieve specific goals
- Studying and improving usability is part of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) -- (Don't Make me Think book)

- Web usability problems
    - long text
    - cluttered, requires horizontal scrolling
    - poorly chosen colors
    - missing navigation controls

- Content usability problems
    - most important content isn't on the first page
    - nondescript headings
    - too many ads
    - important site content in non-HTML format

- More problems
    - users to not raed
    - anchor text that doesn't describe destination
    - visited links dont appear in a different color

- Design Principles
    - Place name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to the home page
        - navbar is a great example

- Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience
    - If most big websites do something in a certain way, then follow along

- Most common site structure 
    -Hierarchical
    -Tips: 3 click rule: generally dont want to be more than 3 clicks away from the content you want
